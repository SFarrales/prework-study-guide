# Study Guide for Coding Boot Camp! 

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation was to go back to my happy place, which was, and always has been, coding. It had been a few years since I had created a website and this project allowed me to get reacquainted with HTML, CSS and JavaScript again. Once I got back into the groove of it, it was like I never stopped. Though, I found that JavaScript and I still have a few creases to iron out before it flows easily like HTML and CSS.
